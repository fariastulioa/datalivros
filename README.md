# Datalivros
Personal project for individual use, built as practice on Python, SQlite, Flask, Matplotlib, Pandas, HTML & Bootstrap.  

It consists of a system to register books I read, that stores informations in a database and allows the user to easily query, search, update, add or remove books from the database.  
Therefore, it can be considered a CRUD web app, with all the basic functionalities of a data management system.  
Furthermore, it has data visualization and descriptive statistics features, which are always generated based on the current (up to date) state of the database.

  
## Instructions  

Running create_db.py resets the database, allowing anyone to create their own database from scratch using books they read.  

The app.py file starts running the Flask web app, which is set to be available on the 5050 port of the local host.  
The Sqlite database stores its data in the booksdb.db file.

The versions for Python and its dependencies used are specified on the 'requirements.tx' file, which was automatically generated via Pigar


  
  
The following screenshots demonstrate several of the app pages in use.
